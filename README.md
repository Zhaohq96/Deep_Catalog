# Deep_Catalog

## About
Deep_Catalog is a deep-learning-model generator for detecting selective sweeps based on stdpopsim and RAiSD-AI. It utilizes stdpopsim to simulate the datasets and uses RAiSD-AI to train the models.

## Enviromental Setup
Deep_Catalog requires stdpopsim and RAiSD-AI for data and model generations. According to our many failed experiences, we recommend to use Anaconda for building a virtual environment to avoid package dependencies. The installation of Anaconda can be found via https://www.anaconda.com/

RAiSD-AI can be downloaded and compiled via https://github.com/alachins/raisd-ai.

To build virtual environment with stdpopsim by command:
